abstract = {Abstract The typical two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2 and black phosphorus have garnered tremendous interest for their unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties. However, all 2D semiconductors reported thus far feature band gaps that are smaller than 2.0 eV, which has greatly restricted their applications, especially in optoelectronic devices with photoresponse in the blue and UV range. Novel 2D mono-elemental semiconductors, namely monolayered arsenene and antimonene, with wide band gaps and high stability were now developed based on first-principles calculations. Interestingly, although As and Sb are typically semimetals in the bulk, they are transformed into indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 2.49 and 2.28 eV when thinned to one atomic layer. Significantly, under small biaxial strain, these materials were transformed from indirect into direct band-gap semiconductors. Such dramatic changes in the electronic structure could pave the way for transistors with high on/off ratios, optoelectronic devices working under blue or UV light, and mechanical sensors based on new 2D crystals.},

	journal = {Nanotechnology},
	abstract = {Two-dimensional topological insulators show great promise for spintronic applications. Much attention has been placed on single atomic or molecular layers, such as bismuthene. The selections of such materials are, however, limited. To broaden the base of candidate materials with desirable properties for applications, we report herein an exploration of the physics of double layers of bismuthene and antimonene. The electronic structure of a film depends on the number of layers, and it can be modified by epitaxial strain, by changing the effective spin–orbit coupling strength, and by the manner in which the layers are geometrically stacked. First-principles calculations for the double layers reveal a number of phases, including topological insulators, topological semimetals, Dirac semimetals, trivial semimetals, and trivial insulators. Their phase boundaries and the stability of the phases are investigated. The results illustrate a rich pattern of phases that can be realized by tuning lattice strain and effective spin–orbit coupling.}

abstract={We demonstrate the emergence of a topological ordered phase for non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, we elucidate that systems with non-Hermitian two-body interactions show a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is considered to be relevant to cold atoms with dissipation. We conclude the emergence of the non-Hermitian FQH state by the presence of the topological degeneracy and by the many-body Chern number for the ground state multiplet showing Ctot{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1. The robust topological degeneracy against non-Hermiticity arises from the manybody translational symmetry. Furthermore, we discover that the FQH state emerges without any repulsive interactions, which is attributed to a phenomenon reminiscent of the continuous quantum Zeno effect.},

year={2014},

volume={13},
number={2},
pages={178-183},
abstract={Three-dimensional topological crystalline insulators were recently predicted and observed in the SnTe class of IV--VI semiconductors, which host metallic surface states protected by crystal symmetries. In this work, we study thin films of these materials and expose their potential for device applications. We demonstrate that thin films of SnTe and Pb1−xSnxSe(Te) grown along the (001) direction are topologically non-trivial in a wide range of film thickness and carry conducting spin-filtered edge states that are protected by the (001) mirror symmetry through a topological invariant. Application of an electric field perpendicular to the film will break the mirror symmetry and generate a bandgap in these edge states. This functionality motivates us to propose a topological transistor device in which charge and spin transport are maximally entangled and simultaneously controlled by an electric field. The high on/off operation speed and coupling of spin and charge in such a device may lead to electronic and spintronic applications for topological crystalline insulators.},

abstract={The recently developed notion of parity--time (PT) symmetry in optical systems has spawned intriguing prospects. So far, most experimental implementations have been reported in solid-state systems. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry---the counterpart of conventional PT symmetry---in a warm atomic-vapour cell. Rapid coherence transport via flying atoms leads to a dissipative coupling between two long-lived atomic spin waves, allowing for the observation of the essential features of anti-PT symmetry with unprecedented precision on the phase-transition threshold, as well as refractionless light propagation. Moreover, we show that a linear or nonlinear interaction between the two spatially separated beams can be achieved. Our results advance non-Hermitian physics by bridging to the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where new phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by (anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.},

	abstract = {The average quantum physicist on the street would say that a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian must be Dirac Hermitian (invariant under combined matrix transposition and complex conjugation) in order to guarantee that the energy eigenvalues are real and that time evolution is unitary. However, the Hamiltonian H = p 2 + ix 3, which is obviously not Dirac Hermitian, has a positive real discrete spectrum and generates unitary time evolution, and thus it defines a fully consistent and physical quantum theory. Evidently, the axiom of Dirac Hermiticity is too restrictive. While H = p 2 + ix 3 is not Dirac Hermitian, it is PT symmetric; that is, invariant under combined parity P (space reflection) and time reversal T. The quantum mechanics defined by a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is a complex generalization of ordinary quantum mechanics. When quantum mechanics is extended into the complex domain, new kinds of theories having strange and remarkable properties emerge. In the past few years, some of these properties have been verified in laboratory experiments. A particularly interesting PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is H = p 2 − x 4, which contains an upside-down potential. This potential is discussed in detail, and it is explained in intuitive as well as in rigorous terms why the energy levels of this potential are real, positive, and discrete. Applications of PT-symmetry in quantum field theory are also discussed.}

abstract = "The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made."

Other effects predicted for PT-symmetric systems are not specific for these systems and can be observed in ordinary fully passive systems.}

abstract = "A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist–Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser."

  	Abstract = {Symmetries play an essential role in identifying and characterizing topological states of matter. Here, we classify topologically two-dimensional (2D) insulators and semimetals with vanishing spin--orbit coupling using time-reversal () and inversion () symmetry. This allows us to link the presence of edge states in  and  symmetric 2D insulators, which are topologically trivial according to the Altland--Zirnbauer table, to a  topological invariant. This invariant is directly related to the quantization of the Zak phase. It also predicts the generic presence of edge states in Dirac semimetals, in the absence of chiral symmetry. We then apply our findings to bilayer black phosphorus and show the occurrence of a gate-induced topological phase transition, where the  invariant changes.},

abstract  ="On the basis of first principles calculations{,} we predict that the PbPo monolayer is a new 2D topological crystalline insulator (TCI) with crystalline-protected Dirac states at the edges. This topologically nontrivial phase stems from the strong crystal field effect in the monolayer{,} which lifts the degeneracy between Po-px{,}y and Pb-pz orbitals{,} thus giving rise to a px{,}y–pz band inversion. As compared to the narrow band gap in bulk PbPo{,} the quantum confinement of the 2D structure leads to a larger band gap of 364.77 meV{,} making it viable for the practical realization of the TCI phase at room temperature. Additionally{,} its band topology is preserved in quantum well formed by sandwiching the PbPo monolayer between NaI layers. This new 2D TCI with a large bulk gap is a potential candidate in future spintronic devices with ultralow dissipation."}

All TIs discovered experimentally so far rely on either time-reversal or mirror crystal symmorphic symmetry to protect massless Dirac-like boundary states. Several materials were recently proposed to be TIs with nonsymmorphic symmetry, where a glide mirror protects exotic surface fermions with hourglass-shaped dispersion. However, an experimental confirmation of this new fermion is missing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide experimental evidence of hourglass fermions on the (010) surface of crystalline KHgSb, whereas the (001) surface has no boundary state, in agreement with first-principles calculations. Our study will stimulate further research activities of topological properties of nonsymmorphic materials.},

abstract={Spatial symmetries in crystals may be distinguished by whether they preserve the spatial origin. Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable zigzag pattern. These `hourglass' fermions are formed in the large-gap insulators, KHgX (X{\thinspace}={\thinspace}As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for topological materials.},

The topological phase in the Bi1−xSbx system is due to an odd number of band inversions. A related spin--orbit system, the Pb1−xSnxTe, has long been known to contain an even number of inversions based on band theory. Here we experimentally investigate the possibility of a mirror symmetry-protected topological crystalline insulator phase in the Pb1−xSnxTe class of materials that has been theoretically predicted to exist in its end compound SnTe. Our experimental results show that at a finite Pb composition above the topological inversion phase transition, the surface exhibits even number of spin-polarized Dirac cone states revealing mirror-protected topological order distinct from that observed in Bi1−xSbx. Our observation of the spin-polarized Dirac surface states in the inverted Pb1−xSnxTe and their absence in the non-inverted compounds related via a topological phase transition provide the experimental groundwork for opening the research on novel topological order in quantum devices.},

abstract={Bismuth (Bi) has been known as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction reaction. Stable free-standing two-dimensional Bi monolayer (Bismuthene) structures have been predicted theoretically, but never realized experimentally. Here, we show the first simple large-scale synthesis of free-standing Bismuthene, to our knowledge, and demonstrate its high electrocatalytic efficiency for formate (HCOO−) formation from CO2 reduction reaction. The catalytic performance is evident by the high Faradaic efficiency (99{\%} at −580 mV vs. Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE)), small onset overpotential (<90{\thinspace}mV) and high durability (no performance decay after 75{\thinspace}h and annealing at 400{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C). Density functional theory calculations show the structure-sensitivity of the CO2 reduction reaction over Bismuthene and thicker nanosheets, suggesting that selective formation of HCOO− indeed can proceed easily on Bismuthene (111) facet due to the unique compressive strain. This work paves the way for the extensive experimental investigation of Bismuthene in many different fields.},

In particular, recent theoretical predictions of unique topological and superconducting properties of thin bismuth films and interfaces prompted intense research on the growth of submonolayers to a few monolayers of bismuth on different substrates. Similar to bulk rhombohedral bismuth, the initial growth of bismuth films on most substrates results in buckled bilayers that grow in either the (111) or (110) directions, with a lattice constant close to that of bulk Bi. By contrast, we show a new growth pattern for bismuth monolayers on NbSe2. We find that the initial growth of Bi can form a strongly bonded commensurate layer, resulting in a compressively strained two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice. We also observed unique pattern of 1D ripples and domain walls is observed. The single layer of bismuth also introduces strong marks on the electronic properties at the surface.},

	abstract = {We have performed an ab initio study of the stability, atomic geometry
and electronic structure of the Bi-covered (√3 ×√3)
reconstructed Si(111) surface. We find that the energetically stable structure
changes from the milkstool model (for 1 monolayer (ML) coverage) to the
T4
model (for 1/3 ML coverage), without going through a stable structure
for the honeycomb model (2/3 ML coverage). Our theoretical scanning
tunnelling microscopy (STM) simulation for the 1 ML coverage reveals
the formation of Bi trimers for occupied states, and a honeycomb image
for empty states. This result, together with the energetically unstable
structure for 2/3 ML coverage, suggests that the experimentally observed STM
image in the form of the honeycomb structure does not mean that the
minimum energy configuration corresponds to Bi coverage of 2/3 ML,
but rather represents current tunnelling into the empty states localized
between Bi trimers for the milkstool model with 1 ML coverage.}

abstract = "The atomic structures of the Bi/Si(111)-(3×3) reconstructed surfaces obtained at different adsorbate coverages were studied by dynamical low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) I–V analysis. The experimentally obtained I–V curves of the β-Bi/Si(111)-(3×3) surface, which is formed by a Bi coverage of 1ML, showed good agreement with the curves calculated for the milk stool model, a model proposed in the literature. In contrast to this result, the I–V curves of the α-phase obtained at a coverage of 1/3ML do not agree with those reported in early LEED studies. We found that the I–V curves reported in the former LEED studies resemble closely to the results obtained for the surface on which the β and α-phases coexist. Based on the obtained I–V curves, we propose a more reliable structural model for the α-phase, and present the way to determine the presence of a high quality α-phase by using LEED."

The Bi/Sb planar honeycombs on SiC(0001) are shown to support a nontrivial band gap as large as 0.56 eV, which harbors a Dirac cone lying within the band gap. Effects of hydrogen atoms placed on either just one side or on both sides of the planar honeycombs are examined. The hydrogenated honeycombs are found to exhibit topologically protected edge states for zigzag as well as armchair edges, with a wide band gap of 1.03 and 0.41 eV in bismuth and antimony films, respectively. Our findings pave the way for using planar bismuth and antimony honeycombs as potential new 2D-TI platforms for room-temperature applications.}

	abstract = {Although of interest to basic research, topological insulators (TIs) have not yet lived up to their technological potential. This is partly because their protected surface-edge state usually lives within a narrow energy gap, with its exotic transport properties overwhelmed by the ordinary bulk material. Reis et al. show that a judicious choice of materials can make the gap wide enough for the topological properties to be apparent at room temperature. Numerical calculations indicate that a monolayer of Bismuth grown on SiC(0001) is a two-dimensional TI with a large energy gap. The researchers fabricated such a heterostructure and characterized it using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The size of the experimentally measured gap was consistent with the calculations.Science, this issue p. 287Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy gaps. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy gap may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-orbit coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high{\textendash}atomic number element and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulating silicon carbide substrate SiC(0001). Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect a gap of ~0.8 electron volt and conductive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system gap, ensuring robust edge conductance.},

Materials that realize either one of these phenomena are scarce, but new work in bismuth-antimony crystals points to a novel state of quantum matter with both properties. Dirac particles have so far been discovered only in graphene, and the topological edge states central to the quantum spin Hall phase have yet to be directly observed. Hsieh et al. now show, through experimental observation of the simple crystal system Bi1−xSbx, that the three-dimensional generalization of both these exotic quantum phases coexist and are highly coupled.

It has been theoretically suggested that the quantum mechanical spin degree of freedom of such surface edge states may be protected against scattering due to topology, which could be useful for spintronics and quantum computing. Now Roushan et al. provide the experimental confirmation of this important prediction.

Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture{\textendash}imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi1{\textendash}xSbx, we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a topological quantum Berry{\textquoteright}s phase and definite spin chirality, which are the key electronic properties component for realizing topological quantum computing bits with intrinsic spin Hall{\textendash}like topological phenomena.},

@article{Gefen_1983,
	Abstract = {Magnetic spin models and resistor networks are studied on certain self-similar fractal lattices, which are described as 'quasi-linear', because they share a significant property of the line: finite portions can be isolated from the rest by removal of two points (sites). In all cases, there is no long-range order at finite temperature. The transition at zero temperature has a discontinuity in the magnetisation, and the associated magnetic exponent is equal to the fractal dimensionality, D. When the lattice reduces to a non-branching curve the thermal exponent v-1=y is equal to D. When the lattice is a branching curve, y is related, respectively, to the dimensionality of the single-channel segments of the curve (for the Ising model), or to the exponent describing the resistivity (for models with continuous spin symmetry).},

	Abstract = {For pt.I see ibid., vol.16, p.1267 (1983). The authors construct and investigate a family of fractals which are generalisations of the Sierpinski gaskets (SGs) to all Euclidean dimensionalities. These fractal lattices have a finite order of ramification, and can be considered 'marginal' between one-dimensional and higher-dimensional geometries. Physical models defined on them are exactly solvable. The authors argue that short-range spin models on the SG show no finite-temperature phase transitions. As examples, they solve a few spin models and study the resistor network and percolation problems on these lattices.},

	Abstract = {For pt.II see ibid. vol.17, p.435 (1984). In the first two papers of this series the authors considered self-similar fractal lattices with a finite order of ramification R. In the present paper they study physical models defined on a family of fractals with R= infinity . In order to characterise the geometry of these systems, they need the connectivity Q and the lacunarity L, in addition to the fractal dimensionality D. It is found that discrete-symmetry spin models on these lattices undergo a phase transition at Tc>0. An approximate renormalisation group scheme is constructed and used to find the dependence of Tc and the critical exponents on the geometrical factors. They also solve the problem of resistor networks on these fractals, and discuss its consequences concerning spin models with continuous symmetry.},

We develop codes to compute all characters of all symmetries of 26,938 stoichiometric materials, and find 3,307 topological insulators, 4,078 topological semimetals and no fragile phases. For these 7,385 materials we provide the electronic band structure, including some electronic properties (bandgap and number of electrons), symmetry indicators, and other topological information. Our results show that more than 27 per cent of all materials in nature are topological. We provide an open-source code that checks the topology of any material and allows other researchers to reproduce our results.},

  abstract={Although the richness of spatial symmetries has led to a rapidly expanding inventory of possible topological crystalline (TC) phases of electrons, physical realizations have been slow to materialize due to the practical difficulty in ascertaining band topology in realistic calculations. Here, we integrate the recently established theory of symmetry indicators of band topology into first-principles band-structure calculations, and test it on a database of previously synthesized crystals. On applying our algorithm to just 8 out of the 230 space groups, we are able to efficiently unearth topological materials and predict a diversity of topological phenomena, including: a screw-protected three-dimensional TC insulator, $\beta$-MoTe2, with gapped surfaces except for one-dimensional helical hinge states; a rotation-protected TC insulator, BiBr, with coexisting surface Dirac cones and hinge states; non-centrosymmetric {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}Bbb Z{\}}{\_}2{\$}{\$}Z2topological insulators undetectable using the well-established parity criterion, AgXO (X{\thinspace}={\thinspace}Na, K, Rb); a Dirac semimetal MgBi2O6; a Dirac nodal-line semimetal AgF2; and a metal with three-fold degenerate band crossing near the Fermi energy, AuLiMgSn. Our work showcases how recent theoretical insights into the fundamentals of band structures can aid in the practical goal of discovering new topological materials.},

@article{Schindler2018,
	Abstract = {The mathematical field of topology has become a framework in which to describe the low-energy electronic structure of crystalline solids. Typical of a bulk insulating three-dimensional topological crystal are conducting two-dimensional surface states. This constitutes the topological bulk--boundary correspondence. Here, we establish that the electronic structure of bismuth, an element consistently described as bulk topologically trivial, is in fact topological and follows a generalized bulk--boundary correspondence of higher-order: not the surfaces of the crystal, but its hinges host topologically protected conducting modes. These hinge modes are protected against localization by time-reversal symmetry locally, and globally by the three-fold rotational symmetry and inversion symmetry of the bismuth crystal. We support our claim theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis is based on symmetry arguments, topological indices, first-principles calculations, and the recently introduced framework of topological quantum chemistry. We provide supporting evidence from two complementary experimental techniques. With scanning-tunnelling spectroscopy, we probe the signatures of the rotational symmetry of the one-dimensional states located at the step edges of the crystal surface. With Josephson interferometry, we demonstrate their universal topological contribution to the electronic transport. Our work establishes bismuth as a higher-order topological insulator.},

Besides fully gapped superconductors, unconventional superconductors with point or line nodes in their order parameter can also exhibit nontrivial topological characteristics. This article reviews recent progress in the theoretical understanding of nodal topological superconductors, with a focus on Weyl and noncentrosymmetric superconductors and their protected surface states. Using selected examples, we review the bulk topological properties of these systems, study different types of topological surface states, and examine their unusual properties. Furthermore, we survey some candidate materials for topological superconductivity and discuss different experimental signatures of topological surface states.}

a conjecture on matrix product states which may provide an alternate way of
arriving at an area law. We also show that, for gapped, local systems, the bound on
Von Neumann entropy implies a bound on Rényi entropy for sufficiently large
α<1
and implies the ability to approximate the ground state by a matrix product
state.}

By employing the torus geometry and the fact that the torus aspect ratio can be readily varied, we can extract the entanglement entropy of a spatial block as a continuous function of the block boundary length. This approach allows us to extract the topological entanglement entropy with an accuracy superior to that possible for the spherical or disc geometry, where no natural continuously variable parameter is available. Other than the topological information, the study of entanglement scaling is also useful as an indicator of the difficulty posed by FQH states for various numerical techniques.}

		Annote = {Frames, or lattices consisting of mass points connected by rigid bonds or central-force springs, are important model constructs that have applications in such diverse fields as structural engineering, architecture and materials science. The difference between the number of bonds and the number of degrees of freedom in these lattices determines the number of their zero-frequency /`floppy modes/'. When these are balanced, the system is on the verge of mechanical instability and is termed isostatic. It has recently been shown that certain extended isostatic lattices exhibit floppy modes localized at their boundary. These boundary modes are insensitive to local perturbations, and seem to have a topological origin, reminiscent of the protected electronic boundary modes that occur in the quantum Hall effect and in topological insulators. Here, we establish the connection between the topological mechanical modes and the topological band theory of electronic systems, and we predict the existence of new topological bulk mechanical phases with distinct boundary modes. We introduce one- and two- dimensional model systems that exemplify this phenomenon.},

			Abstract = {Invented by Alessandro Volta and F{\'e}lix Savary in the early 19th century, circuits consisting of resistor, inductor and capacitor (RLC) components are omnipresent in modern technology. The behavior of an RLC circuit is governed by its circuit Laplacian, which is analogous to the Hamiltonian describing the energetics of a physical system. Here we show that topological insulating and semimetallic states can be realized in a periodic RLC circuit. Topological boundary resonances (TBRs) appear in the impedance read-out of a topolectrical circuit, providing a robust signal for the presence of topological admittance bands. For experimental illustration, we build the Su-Schrieffer--Heeger circuit, where our impedance measurement detects the TBR midgap state. Topolectrical circuits establish a bridge between electrical engineering and topological states of matter, where the accessibility, scalability, and operability of electronics synergizes with the intricate boundary properties of topological phases.},

We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems there appears a gapless phase between the QSH and insulator phases in 3D which is in contrast with the 2D case. Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless points (diabolical points) in 3D, but not in 2D.}

	abstract={Bulk--boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Therein, the intriguing localization of nominal bulk states at boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggests a non-Bloch band theory in which non-Bloch topological invariants are defined in generalized Brillouin zones, leading to a general bulk--boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework. Here, we experimentally observe this fundamental non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence in discrete-time non-unitary quantum-walk dynamics of single photons. We demonstrate pronounced photon localizations near boundaries even in the absence of topological edge states, thus confirming the non-Hermitian skin effect. Facilitated by our experimental scheme of edge-state reconstruction, we directly measure topological edge states, which are in excellent agreement with the non-Bloch topological invariants. Our work unequivocally establishes the non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence as a general principle underlying non-Hermitian topological systems and paves the way for a complete understanding of topological matter in open systems.},

	journal={Nature Physics},

	month={6},

	abstract={The study of the laws of nature has traditionally been pursued in the limit of isolated systems, where energy is conserved. This is not always a valid approximation, however, as the inclusion of features such as gain and loss, or periodic driving, qualitatively amends these laws. A contemporary frontier of metamaterial research is the challenge open systems pose to the characterization of topological matter1,2. Here, one of the most relied upon principles is the bulk--boundary correspondence (BBC), which intimately relates the surface states to the topological classification of the bulk3,4. The presence of gain and loss, in combination with the violation of reciprocity, has been predicted to affect this principle dramatically5,6. Here, we report the experimental observation of BBC violation in a non-reciprocal topolectric circuit7, which is also referred to as the non-Hermitian skin effect. The circuit admittance spectrum exhibits an unprecedented sensitivity to the presence of a boundary, displaying an extensive admittance mode localization despite a translationally invariant bulk. Intriguingly, we measure a non-local voltage response due to broken BBC. Depending on the a.c. current feed frequency, the voltage signal accumulates at the left or right boundary, and increases as a function of nodal distance to the current feed.},

	Abstract = {{\enspace}The integral quantum Hall effect can be explained either as resulting from bulk or edge currents (or, as it occurs in real samples, as a combination of both). This leads to different definitions of Hall conductance, which agree under appropriate hypotheses, as shown by Schulz-Baldes et al. by means of K-theory. We propose an alternative proof based on a generalization of the index of a pair of projections to more general operators. The equality of conductances is an expression of the stability of that index as a flux tube is moved from within the bulk across the boundary of a sample.},

This article reviews recent progress in understanding the topological superfluidity of 3He in a multifaceted manner, including symmetry considerations, the Jackiw–Rebbi's index theorem, and the quasiclassical theory. Special focus is placed on the symmetry protected topological superfuidity of the 3He-B confined in a slab geometry. The 3He-B under a magnetic field is separated to two different sub-phases: the symmetry protected topological phase and non-topological phase. The former phase is characterized by the existence of symmetry protected Majorana fermions. The topological phase transition between them is triggered by the spontaneous breaking of a hidden discrete symmetry. The critical field is quantitatively determined from the microscopic calculation that takes account of magnetic dipole interaction of the 3He nucleus. It is also demonstrated that odd-frequency even-parity Cooper pair amplitudes are emergent in low-lying quasiparticles. The key ingredients, symmetry protected Majorana fermions and odd-frequency pairing, bring an important consequence that the coupling of the surface states to an applied field is prohibited by the hidden discrete symmetry, while the topological phase transition with the spontaneous symmetry breaking is accompanied by anomalous enhancement and anisotropic quantum criticality of surface spin susceptibility. We also illustrate common topological features between topological crystalline superconductors and symmetry protected topological superfluids, taking UPt3 and Rashba superconductors as examples.}

			Abstract = {Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups, we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more.},

The main idea of a synthetic dimension is to couple together suitable degrees of freedom, such as a set of internal atomic states, in order to mimic the motion of a particle along an extra spatial dimension. This approach provides a way to engineer lattice Hamiltonians and enables the realization of higher-dimensional topological models in platforms with lower dimensionality. We give an overview of the recent progress in studying topological matter in synthetic dimensions. After reviewing proposals and realizations in various set-ups, we discuss future prospects in many-body physics, applications and topological effects in three or more spatial dimensions.},

	abstract={Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter in which surface states residing in the bulk insulating gap of such systems are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The study of such states was originally inspired by the robustness to scattering of conducting edge states in quantum Hall systems. Recently, such analogies have resulted in the discovery of topologically protected states in two-dimensional and three-dimensional band insulators with large spin--orbit coupling. So far, the only known three-dimensional topological insulator is BixSb1−x, which is an alloy with complex surface states. Here, we present the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations of the layered, stoichiometric crystals Sb2Te3, Sb2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. Our calculations predict that Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 are topological insulators, whereas Sb2Se3 is not. These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the $\Gamma$ point. In addition, we predict that Bi2Se3 has a topologically non-trivial energy gap of 0.3{\thinspace}eV, which is larger than the energy scale of room temperature. We further present a simple and unified continuum model that captures the salient topological features of this class of materials.},

@article{MolenkampQSHE2007,
	Abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck{\textquoteright}s constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field{\textendash}induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

We prove the equivalence between the two descriptions for two-dimensional solids in the single-particle picture. We give a new formulation of the {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb{\{}Z{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}Z2-invariant, which allows for a bulk index not relying on a (two-dimensional) Brillouin zone. When available though, that index is shown to agree with known formulations. The method also applies to integer quantum Hall systems. We discuss a further variant of the correspondence, based on scattering theory.},

	Abstract = {We derive formulas and algorithms for Kitaev's invariants in the periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors for finite disordered systems on lattices with boundaries. We find that K-theory arises as an obstruction to perturbing approximately compatible observables into compatible observables. We derive formulas in all symmetry classes up to dimension two, and in one symmetry class in dimension three, that can be computed with sparse matrix algorithms. We present algorithms in two symmetry classes in 2D and one in 3D and provide illustrative studies regarding how these algorithms can detect the scaling properties of phase transitions.},

We show that the topological group structure of bulk Hamiltonians and topological defects is exponentially extended when this additional condition is met and examine some of its physical consequences. Those include localization--delocalization transitions between topological phases with the same boundary conductance as well as gapless topological defects stabilized by average reflection symmetry.},

@article{SongZhang17,
	Abstract = {The study of spatial symmetries was accomplished during the last century and had greatly improved our understanding of the properties of solids. Nowadays, the symmetry data of any crystal can be readily extracted from standard first-principles calculation. On the other hand, the topological data (topological invariants), the defining quantities of nontrivial topological states, are in general considerably difficult to obtain, and this difficulty has critically slowed down the search for topological materials. Here we provide explicit and exhaustive mappings from symmetry data to topological data for arbitrary gapped band structure in the presence of time-reversal symmetry and any one of the 230 space groups. The mappings are completed using the theoretical tools of layer construction and symmetry-based indicators. With these results, finding topological invariants in any given gapped band structure reduces to a simple search in the mapping tables provided.},

@article{HOTI12018,
	Abstract = {Three-dimensional topological (crystalline) insulators are materials with an insulating bulk but conducting surface states that are topologically protected by time-reversal (or spatial) symmetries. We extend the notion of three-dimensional topological insulators to systems that host no gapless surface states but exhibit topologically protected gapless hinge states. Their topological character is protected by spatiotemporal symmetries of which we present two cases: (i) Chiral higher-order topological insulators protected by the combination of time-reversal and a fourfold rotation symmetry. Their hinge states are chiral modes, and the bulk topology is Z2-classified. (ii) Helical higher-order topological insulators protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries. Their hinge states come in Kramers pairs, and the bulk topology is Z-classified. We provide the topological invariants for both cases. Furthermore, we show that SnTe as well as surface-modified Bi2TeI, BiSe, and BiTe are helical higher-order topological insulators and propose a realistic experimental setup to detect the hinge states.},

	abstract={The study of the laws of nature has traditionally been pursued in the limit of isolated systems, where energy is conserved. This is not always a valid approximation, however, as the inclusion of features such as gain and loss, or periodic driving, qualitatively amends these laws. A contemporary frontier of metamaterial research is the challenge open systems pose to the characterization of topological matter1,2. Here, one of the most relied upon principles is the bulk--boundary correspondence (BBC), which intimately relates the surface states to the topological classification of the bulk3,4. The presence of gain and loss, in combination with the violation of reciprocity, has been predicted to affect this principle dramatically5,6. Here, we report the experimental observation of BBC violation in a non-reciprocal topolectric circuit7, which is also referred to as the non-Hermitian skin effect. The circuit admittance spectrum exhibits an unprecedented sensitivity to the presence of a boundary, displaying an extensive admittance mode localization despite a translationally invariant bulk. Intriguingly, we measure a non-local voltage response due to broken BBC. Depending on the a.c. current feed frequency, the voltage signal accumulates at the left or right boundary, and increases as a function of nodal distance to the current feed.},

		abstract = {Scattering topological effects are being explored in a variety of electronic and optical materials systems owing to their robustness against defects (see the Perspective by {\"O}zdemir). Yang et al. designed and fabricated an ideal optical analog of a three-dimensional Weyl system. Angular transmission measurements revealed four Weyl points at the same energy, as well as the signature helicoidal arcs associated with such an exotic topological system. Zhou et al. theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated the formation of a topologically protected bulk Fermi arc. They attributed the formation of the arc to the topological nature of paired exceptional points (points at which gain and loss in the system are matched). Photonic crystals may provide a powerful platform for studying exotic properties of topological electronic systems and may also be used to develop optical devices that exploit topological properties of light-matter interactions.Science, this issue p. 1013, p. 1009; see also p. 995The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.},

	title = {Why does bulk boundary correspondence fail in some non-hermitian topological models},
	journal = {Journal of Physics Communications},
	abstract = {The bulk-boundary correspondence is crucial to topological insulators. It associates the existence of boundary states (with zero energy and possessing chiral or helical properties) with the topological numbers defined in bulk. In recent years, topology has been extended to non-hermitian systems, opening a new research area called non-hermitian topological insulator. In this paper, however, we will illustrate that the bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold in these new models. This is because a prerequisite condition: ‘the boundaries cannot alter most of the bulk states, so as to the topological numbers defined on them’ does not hold any longer. This cuts out the correspondence between the topological numbers and the boundary states. We will illustrate that, as approaching the open boundary condition by eliminating the strength of the hopping between the two ends of a chain, a new series of exceptional points must be passed through and the topological structure of the spectrum in the complex plane has been changed. This makes the spectrum topology different for the chains with and without boundaries. We also discuss that such exotic behavior does not emerge when the open boundary is replaced by a domain-wall. So the index theorem can be applied to the systems with domain-walls but cannot be further used to those with open boundaries.}

In this Perspective we give an overview with a focus in connecting this topic to others like Floquet systems. Furthermore, using a simple scattering picture we discuss an interpretation of concepts like the Hamiltonian's defectiveness, i.e. the lack of a full basis of eigenstates, crucial in many discussions of topological phases of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.}

	Abstract = {We have developed and implemented a selfconsistent density
functional  method using standard norm-conserving
pseudopotentials and a flexible,  numerical
linear combination of atomic orbitals basis set,
which includes multiple-zeta and polarization  orbitals.
Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density
or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and
the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in
order to calculate the Hartree and  exchange-correlation
potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that
scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified
energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal
wavefunctions and the same energy and density  as the Kohn-Sham
energy functional, without the need for an explicit
orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like
electron wavefunctions   allows the computation time and memory
required to minimize  the energy to also scale linearly with
the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated
efficiently and accurately,  thus allowing structural relaxation
and molecular dynamics simulations.},

			@article{VANSETTEN201839,
				Abstract = {First-principles calculations in crystalline structures are often performed with a planewave basis set. To make the number of basis functions tractable two approximations are usually introduced: core electrons are frozen and the diverging Coulomb potential near the nucleus is replaced by a smoother expression. The norm-conserving pseudopotential was the first successful method to apply these approximations in a fully ab initio way. Later on, more efficient and more exact approaches were developed based on the ultrasoft and the projector augmented wave formalisms. These formalisms are however more complex and developing new features in these frameworks is usually more difficult than in the norm-conserving framework. Most of the existing tables of norm-conserving pseudopotentials, generated long ago, do not include the latest developments, are not systematically tested or are not designed primarily for high precision. In this paper, we present our PseudoDojo framework for developing and testing full tables of pseudopotentials, and demonstrate it with a new table generated with the ONCVPSP approach. The PseudoDojo is an open source project, building on the AbiPy package, for developing and systematically testing pseudopotentials. At present it contains 7 different batteries of tests executed with ABINIT, which are performed as a function of the energy cutoff. The results of these tests are then used to provide hints for the energy cutoff for actual production calculations. Our final set contains 141 pseudopotentials split into a standard and a stringent accuracy table. In total around 70,000 calculations were performed to test the pseudopotentials. The process of developing the final table led to new insights into the effects of both the core-valence partitioning and the non-linear core corrections on the stability, convergence, and transferability of norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The PseudoDojo hence provides a set of pseudopotentials and general purpose tools for further testing and development, focusing on highly accurate calculations and their use in the development of ab initio packages. The pseudopotential files are available on the PseudoDojo web-interface pseudo-dojo.org under the name NC (ONCVPSP) v0.4 in the psp8, UPF2, and PSML 1.1 formats. The webinterface also provides the inputs, which are compatible with the 3.3.1 and higher versions of ONCVPSP. All tests have been performed with ABINIT 8.4.},
