\chapter{Topological states in fractal lattices}
\label{ch:fractals}

Underlying geometry in quantum lattice models plays an important role in defining their electronic properties (

Interestingly, the authors in pointed out that topological states can be realized even in amorphous solids. Fractal lattices comprise of many interesting features: they are aperiodic, but scale invariant. Also, there is no sharp notion between bulk and edge.

Here, we are interested in the lattice regularization of two fractals, Sierpi≈Ñski carpet (SC) and triangle (or gasket) (SG). This approach is relevant for potential experimental realization as it introduces the distance between nearest-neighbouring sites (lattice constant) to be a natural cutoff.

The reason why we investigate these lattices is motivated by their distinct Hausdorff dimensions ($d_H = \ln A / \ln L$, where $A$ is the area and $L$ the linear size) and connectivity properties. Firstly, $d_H = 1.892 \ldots$ for SC and $d_H = 1.585 \ldots$ for SG. 



We consider tight-binding model of spinless electrons exposed to a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian reads
\begin{equation}
H = -t  \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} e^{\textnormal{i} A_{ij}} c^{\dagger}_i c_j + \mathrm{h.c.},
\label{eq:frac_ham}
\end{equation}
where we set $t = 1$.

One of the difficulties is to compute topological invariants in that systems as they do not exhibit translational invariance. One may therefore employ real-space methods. Other methods (for example, the Bott index) may be numerically insufficient. Here, we used the real-space expression for the Chern number:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C} = 12 \pi i \sum_{j \in A} \sum_{k \in B} \sum_{l \in C} \left( P_{jk} P_{kl} P_{lj} - P_{jl} P_{lk} P_{kj} \right),
\label{eq: chern_real}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the projector operator onto occupied states and $i, j, l$ label the lattice sites.



As an ultimate probe, we study potential topological phase transition with the level spacing statistics. Depending whether states are extended or localized, they follow Wigner-Dyson or Poisson distribution, respectively. To do so, we add the on-site disorder term $\sum_i V_i c_i^{\dagger} c_i$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:frac_ham}, where $V_i$ is drawn from a uniform distribution $[-W/2, W/2 ]$. Having computed the level spacings, we calculate their variance and average over $500$ disorder realizations for each disorder strength $W$.
