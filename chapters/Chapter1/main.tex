\chapter{Topological band theory}
\label{ch:topo-intro}

If the system has a translational invariance, then the states can be represented in the form of Bloch states labeled by the band index $n$ and momenta $k$.


For two-dimensions, it is given by the (first) Chern number:
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{1}{2 \pi}
\end{equation}


There's another striking consequence of non-trivial (non-zero) bulk topological index - the presence of protected gapless edge modes in the open geometry. Even though there's no rigorous proof for the bulk-boundary correspondence, it works remarkably well.
