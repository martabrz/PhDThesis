First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors from Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, for helping me during the first years of my PhD studies and encouraging me to work in the field of condensed matter physics.

I would like to thank Titus Neupert for giving me the life-changing opportunity to pursue my research in Switzerland and my colleagues from Condensed Matter Theory Group at University of Zurich - I had a great time with having you around.

I also want to thank my family for their constant support and love.
